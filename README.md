# Dotfiles

This repository contains various configuration and dotfiles. You're welcome to
steal anything you like.

## Usage

Getting started is easy: just run `./link.sh` to symlink the dotfiles to their
appropriate directories.

> **Warning!** `link.sh` will first attempt to remove any existing dotfiles. You
> probably want to back up anything you care about.
